The Connection string needs to be changed to the localdb server name. 
For instance the current connection string in the appsetting.json file is this: 

"ConnectionStrings": {
    "SqlConnection": "server=LAPTOP-EOP88J19\\SQLEXPRESS; database=CMPS_339_AmusementPark; Integrated Security=true; Encrypt=false"
  },
  
  Change the server='...'; value to the one where the localdb ssms server name.
